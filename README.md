# Testrepo

## Tips

1. Always push branch on github after you done with the work

2. Always pull branch before start to work

3. Always look on status of branch and code differences before commit

4. If you have merging with conflicts, check your branch status
before commit and make sure all changes are in staging area

## Useful commands

1. If you need abort merging with conflict use: ```git merge abort```

2. If you need update remote branches use: ```git remote update```

remote, not locale! Don't be confused
